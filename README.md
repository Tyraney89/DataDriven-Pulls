## Purpose
I created this project because my dad is passionate about tractor pulling. He currently tracks detailed stats about each event in his iPhone's Notes app, but I wanted to provide him with a more structured and efficient way to organize this data. Additionally, I saw this as an opportunity to explore mobile development.  

This project ultimately didnâ€™t make it onto the App Store due to the cost of the Apple Developer Program and my limited bandwidth to support monetizing the app. Maybe one day, Iâ€™ll return to this project to finish it and potentially add AI/ML, since the project is centered around data. I would also implement **CloudKit** so users could access their data on any device, as long as they are logged into their Apple account. (I didnâ€™t already do this because an Apple Developer account is required.)

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to build an app that helps my dad organize his tractor pull records. I initially planned for it to be a simple **CRUD application**.  

I chose **SwiftUI** because, at the time of development, it was Apple's latest framework. I also wanted to gain experience with **declarative programming**. As a bonus, SwiftUI's **adaptive layout** capabilities made it easier to support all screen sizes.

## Views
This mobile application consists of four main views:
1. **Home View** â€“ The main screen for managing pulls.
2. **Detailed Pull View** â€“ Displays details for a selected pull.
3. **Insert Pull View** â€“ Used to add a new pull.
4. **Insert Hook View** â€“ Used to add a hook (a single run down the track).  

> **Note**: In tractor pulling, a **hook** refers to a single run down the track. Many events allow multiple hooks per tractor.

### Home View
This view allows the user to:
- **Add** a new pull using the âž• button in the top-right corner.
- **Select** a pull to view its details.
- **Swipe right** to delete a pull.

### Detailed Pull View
This view provides three main functions:
- **Add** a new hook by clicking the button.
- **Edit** a hook by selecting it.
- **Swipe to delete** a hook.

### Insert Views
Both views are simple forms that allow the user to input data.

## Data
I used **SwiftData** to ensure data persistence in the app. The data model follows a **one-to-many relationship**, where:
- Each **pull** can have multiple **hooks**.
- Each **hook** must belong to a **pull**.

This structure was straightforward to implement, as shown below:

## Early Designs
These are some early sketches from when I came up with the idea of making this app. I didn't want to make overly complecated wireframe sketches for this project. I knew I was gonna be using SwifUI so I wanted to adapt the design that would be provided by apple. I still wanted some personal touch to the app so I made some custom stuff like the individual pull component and hook component.

### Future Improvements
If I revisit this project, Iâ€™d consider:
- Implementing **AI/ML** features using **Apple Intelligence** or integrating **Firestore** to build my own model.
- Adding **CloudKit** support for seamless data sync across devices.
